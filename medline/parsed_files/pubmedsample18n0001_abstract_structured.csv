8219565,OBJECTIVE,PURPOSE,The problem of asymmetric opening of the modified hook titanium Greenfield inferior vena cava filter necessitating transcatheter manipulation was evaluated in a retrospective study.
8219565,METHODS,PATIENTS AND METHODS,Titanium Greenfield filters were placed in 166 patients over a 36-month period. The radiographic reports of all patients were reviewed to identify cases in which the filter failed to open symmetrically after deployment and catheter or wire manipulation of the filter was performed. The reports and angiograms from these patients were reviewed with respect to the circumstances surrounding filter placement and methods to achieve more symmetric opening.
8219565,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Transcatheter manipulation of asymmetrically opened filters was performed in 15 of 166 cases (9%). In 12 of these patients, acceptable and uneventful opening of the filter was achieved with a guide wire, pigtail catheter, or occlusion balloon catheter. In one case manipulation only partly improved orientation of the limbs, while in another case successful manipulation was complicated by distal migration. In the final case, the asymmetric filter covered only part of the lumen of the vena cava despite manipulations and a second filter was placed for optimal caval interruption. No specific cause for incomplete expansion was identified in any case."
8219565,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSION,"Marked asymmetry in opening of the modified hook titanium Greenfield filter that warrants manipulation occurs infrequently, but recognition and proper management may be important to ensure optimal caval interruption."
9110943,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVE,"This overview reports the efficacy of conservative treatments (drug therapy, manual therapy, patient education, physical medicine modalities) in reducing pain in adults with mechanical neck disorders."
9110943,METHODS,METHODS,"Computerized bibliographic database searches from 1985 to December 1993, information requests from authors, and bibliography screenings were used to identify published and unpublished research. Applying strict criteria, two investigators independently reviewed the blinded articles. Each selected trial was evaluated independently for methodologic quality."
9110943,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight before-after studies met our selection criteria. Twenty RCTs rated moderately strong or better in terms of methodologic quality. Five trials using manual therapy in combination with other treatments were clinically similar, were statistically not heterogeneous (p = 0.98), and were combined to yield an effect size of -0.6 (95% CI: -0.9, -0.4), equivalent to a 16 point improvement on a 100 point pain scale. Four RCTs using physical medicine modalities were combined using the inverse chi-square method: two using electromagnetic therapy produced a significant reduction in pain (p < 0.01); and two using laser therapy did not differ significantly from a placebo (p = 0.63). Little or no scientific evidence exists for other therapies, including such commonly used treatments as medication, rest and exercise."
9110943,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,"Within the limits of methodologic quality, the best available evidence supports the use of manual therapies in combination with other treatments for short-term relief of neck pain. There is some support for the use of electromagnetic therapy and against the use of laser therapy. In general, other interventions have not been studied in enough detail adequately to assess efficacy or effectiveness. This overview provides the foundation for an evidence-based approach to practice. More robust design and methodology should be used in future research, in particular, the use of valid and reliable outcomes measures."
8941094,BACKGROUND,BACKGROUND,"To date, late redistribution after resting 201Tl injection has not been evaluated. In addition, the concordance between resting 201Tl imaging and dobutamine echocardiography in identifying viable myocardium has not been assessed."
8941094,RESULTS,METHODS AND RESULTS,"Forty patients with coronary artery disease underwent rest-4-hour-24-hour 201Tl tomography and dobutamine echocardiography (5 to 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Late redistribution occurred in 46 (21%) of 219 persistent defects at 4 hours. Systolic function and contractile reserve were similar among persistent defects at 4 hours with and without late redistribution. Contractile reserve was more frequent in segments with normal 201Tl uptake (59%), completely reversible defects (53%), or mild to moderate defects at 4 hours (56%) compared with severe defects (14%; P < .02 versus all). Of 105 hypokinetic segments, 99 (94%) were viable by 201Tl, and 88 (84%) showed contractile reserve. In contrast, of 155 akinetic segments, 119 (77%) were viable by 201Tl, but only 34 (22%) had contractile reserve. Concordance between 201Tl and dobutamine was 82% in hypokinetic segments but 43% in akinetic segments. In 109 revascularized segments, positive accuracy for functional recovery was 72% for 201Tl and 92% for dobutamine, whereas negative accuracy was 100% and 65%, respectively. Sensitivity was 100% for 201Tl and 79% for dobutamine."
8941094,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,"Late redistribution occurs in one fifth of persistent defects at 4 hours, and it does not correlate to systolic function or contractile reserve. Dobutamine and 201Tl yield concordant information in the majority of hypokinetic segments, whereas concordance is low in akinetic segments. Dobutamine demonstrates higher positive accuracy and sensitivity in predicting recovery of dysfunctional myocardium, whereas 201Tl shows higher negative predictive accuracy but reduced positive accuracy."
9627170,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVE,"Today, sepsis syndrome is the leading cause of death in adult, non-coronary intensive care units (ICUs) and is of great clinical importance. The purpose of this review was to evaluate recent prospective studies concerning the short- and long-term prognosis of patients suffering from systemic inflammatory-response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. It has been shown in multicentre prospective surveys that 1% and 0.3% of all patients admitted to hospitals suffer, respectively, from bacteraemia alone and bacteraemia with severe sepsis. This rate increases, of course, when only admissions to the ICUs are considered: the above-mentioned rates increase then by a factor of 8 and 30, respectively. Thus, approximately 10% of patients in the ICU suffer from sepsis, 6% from severe sepsis and 2-3% from septic shock. SIRS occurs more frequently and its occurrence ranges from 40% to 70% of all patients admitted to ICUs. Thereby, 40-70% suffering from SIRS progress to a more severe septic-disease state. The overall prognosis is still poor, despite the recent advances in ICU treatment. The mortality rate of SIRS ranges from 6% to 7% and in septic shock amounts to over 50%. In particular, abdominal sepsis exhibits the highest mortality rate with 72%. The long-term prognosis is equally poor; only approximately 30% survived the first year after hospital admission."
9627170,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSION,"The prognosis of sepsis and septic shock remains poor, despite the advances in ICU treatment. Although prognostic factors have been identified for some patients, groups have not yet been able to identify the immediate or long-term prognosis for the majority of these septic patients."
10331749,OBJECTIVE,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE,"Body positioning exerts a strong effect on pulmonary function, but its effect on other components of the oxygen transport pathway are less well understood, especially the effects of side-lying positions. This study investigated the interrelationships between side-lying positions and indexes of lung function such as spirometry, alveolar diffusing capacity, and inhomogeneity of ventilation in older individuals."
10331749,METHODS,SUBJECTS AND METHODS,"Nineteen nonsmoking subjects (mean age=62.8 years, SD=6.8, range=50-74) with no history of cardiac or pulmonary disease were tested over 2 sessions. The test positions were sitting and left side lying in one session and sitting and right side lying in the other session. In each of the positions, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), single-breath pulmonary diffusing capacity (DLCO/VA), and the slope of phase III (DN2%/L) of the single-breath nitrogen washout test to determine inhomogeneity of ventilation were measured."
10331749,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Compared with measurements obtained in the sitting position, FVC and FEV1 were decreased equally in the side-lying positions, but no change was observed in DLCO/VA or DN2%/L."
10331749,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION,"Side-lying positions resulted in decreases in FVC and FEV1, which is consistent with the well-documented effects of the supine position. These findings further support the need for prescriptive rather than routine body positioning of patients with risks of cardiopulmonary compromise and the need to use upright positions in which lung volumes and capacities are maximized."
11034741,BACKGROUND,BACKGROUND,"The prevalence of mental health problems in women is 1:3 and such problems tend to be persistent. There is evidence from a range of studies to suggest that a number of factors relating to maternal psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the mother-infant relationship, and that this can have consequences for the psychological health of the child. It is now thought that parenting programmes may have an important role to play in the improvement of maternal psychosocial health."
11034741,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVES,"The objective of this review is to address whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving maternal psychosocial health including anxiety, depression and self-esteem."
11034741,METHODS,SEARCH STRATEGY,"A range of biomedical, social science, educational and general reference electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE CINAHL, PsychLIT, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociofile and the Social Science Citation Index. Other sources of information included the Cochrane Library (SPECTR, CENTRAL), and the National Research Register (NRR)."
11034741,METHODS,SELECTION CRITERIA,"Only randomised controlled trials were included in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental and a control group, the latter being either a waiting-list, no-treatment or a placebo control group. Studies had to include at least one group-based parenting programme, and one standardised instrument measuring maternal psychosocial health."
11034741,METHODS,DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS,A systematic critical appraisal of all included studies was undertaken using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published criteria. The data were summarised using effect sizes but were not combined in a meta-analysis due to the small number of studies within each group and the presence of significant heterogeneity.
11034741,RESULTS,MAIN RESULTS,"A total of 22 studies were included in the review but only 17 provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. These 17 studies reported on a total of 59 outcomes including depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, social competence, social support, guilt, mood, automatic thoughts, dyadic adjustment, psychiatric morbidity, irrationality, anger and aggression, mood, attitude, personality, and beliefs. Approximately 22% of the outcomes measured suggested significant differences favouring the intervention group. A further 40% showed differences favouring the intervention group but which failed to achieve conventional levels of statistical significance, in some cases due to the small numbers that were used. Approximately 38% of outcomes suggested no evidence of effectiveness."
11034741,CONCLUSIONS,REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS,"It is suggested that parenting programmes can make a significant contribution to the improvement of psychosocial health in mothers. While the critical appraisal suggests some variability in the quality of the included studies, it is concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support their use with diverse groups of parents. However, it is also suggested that some caution should be exercised before the results are generalised to parents irrespective of the level of pathology present, and that further research is still required."
11279676,BACKGROUND,BACKGROUND,"Elective caesarean delivery for women in preterm labour might reduce the chances of fetal or neonatal death, but it might also increase the risk of maternal morbidity."
11279676,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVES,To assess the effects of a policy of elective caesarean delivery versus selective caesarean delivery for women in preterm labour.
11279676,METHODS,SEARCH STRATEGY,The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register was searched. Date of last search: September 2000.
11279676,METHODS,SELECTION CRITERIA,Randomised trials comparing a policy of elective caesarean delivery versus expectant management with recourse to caesarean section.
11279676,METHODS,DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS,"One reviewer assessed eligibility and trial quality, and both contributed to the update."
11279676,RESULTS,MAIN RESULTS,"Six studies involving 122 women were included. All trials reported recruiting difficulties. No significant differences between elective and selective policies for caesarean delivery were found for fetal, neonatal or maternal outcomes."
11279676,CONCLUSIONS,REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS,"There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of a policy for elective caesarean delivery for small babies. Randomised trials in this area are likely to continue to experience recruitment problems. However, it still may be possible to investigate elective caesarean delivery in preterm babies with cephalic presentations."
11406024,BACKGROUND,BACKGROUND,"Mental health problems are common, and there is evidence from a range of studies to suggest that a number of factors relating to maternal psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the mother-infant relationship, and that this can have consequences for both the short and long-term psychological health of the child. The use of parenting programmes is increasing in the UK and evidence of their effectiveness in improving outcomes for mothers is now required."
11406024,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVES,"The objective of this review is to address whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving maternal psychosocial health including anxiety, depression, and self-esteem."
11406024,METHODS,SEARCH STRATEGY,"A range of biomedical, social science, educational and general reference electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, EMBASE CINAHL, PsychLIT, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociofile and the Social Science Citation Index. Other sources of information included the Cochrane Library (SPECTR, CENTRAL), and the National Research Register (NRR)."
11406024,METHODS,SELECTION CRITERIA,"Only randomised controlled trials were included in which participants had been randomly allocated to an experimental and a control group, the latter being either a waiting-list, no-treatment or a placebo control group. Studies had to include at least one group-based parenting programme, and one standardised instrument measuring maternal psychosocial health."
11406024,METHODS,DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS,"A systematic critical appraisal of all included studies was undertaken using a modified version of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published criteria. The treatment effect for each outcome in each study was standardised by dividing the mean difference in post-intervention scores for the intervention and treatment group, by the pooled standard deviation, to produce an effect size. Where appropriate the results were then combined in a meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model, and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the significance of the findings."
11406024,RESULTS,MAIN RESULTS,"A total of 23 studies were included in the review but only 17 provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. The 17 studies provided a total of 59 assessments of outcome on a range of aspects of psychosocial functioning including depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, social competence, social support, guilt, mood, automatic thoughts, dyadic adjustment, psychiatric morbidity, irrationality, anger and aggression, mood, attitude, personality, and beliefs. There was only sufficient data, however, on five outcomes (depression; anxiety/stress; self-esteem; social support; and relationship with spouse/marital adjustment) to combine the results in a meta-analysis. The meta-analyses show statistically significant results favouring the intervention group as regards depression; anxiety/stress; self-esteem; and relationship with spouse/marital adjustment. The meta-analysis of the social support data, however, showed no evidence of effectiveness. These results suggest that parenting programmes, irrespective of the type (or content) of programme, can be effective in improving important aspects of maternal psycho-social functioning. Of the data summarising the effectiveness of the different types of parenting programmes, which it was not possible to combine in a meta-analysis, approximately 22% of the outcomes measured, showed significant differences between the intervention group and the control group. A further 40% showed medium to large non-significant differences favouring the intervention group. Approximately one-third of outcomes showed small non-significant differences or no evidence of effectiveness. A meta-analysis of the follow-up data on three outcomes was also conducted - depression, self-esteem and relationship with spouse/marital adjustment. The results show that there was a continued improvement in self-esteem, depression and marital adjustment at follow-up, although the latter two findings were not statistically significant."
11406024,CONCLUSIONS,REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS,"It is suggested that parenting programmes can make a significant contribution to short-term psychosocial health in mothers, and that the limited follow-up data available suggest that these are maintained over time. However, the overall paucity of long-term follow-up data points to the need for further evidence concerning the long-term effectiveness of parenting programmes on maternal mental health. Furthermore, it is suggested that some caution should be exercised before the results are generalised to parents irrespective of the level of pathology present, and that further research is still required."
11442735,OBJECTIVE,AIM,"In the present 6-month multicentre trial, the outcome of 2 different approaches to non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis, both involving the use of a locally delivered controlled-release doxycycline, was evaluated."
11442735,METHODS,MATERIAL AND METHODS,"105 adult patients with moderately advanced chronic periodontitis from 3 centres participated in the trial. Each patient had to present with at least 8 periodontal sites in 2 jaw quadrants with a probing pocket depth (PPD) of > or =5 mm and bleeding following pocket probing (BoP), out of which at least 2 sites had to be > or =7 mm and a further 2 sites > or =6 mm. Following a baseline examination, including assessments of plaque, PPD, clinical attachment level (CAL) and BoP, careful instruction in oral hygiene was given. The patients were then randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: scaling/root planing (SRP) with local analgesia or debridement (supra- and subgingival ultrasonic instrumentation without analgesia). The \"SRP\" group received a single episode of full-mouth supra-/subgingival scaling and root planing under local analgesia. In addition, at a 3-month recall visit, a full-mouth supra-/subgingival debridement using ultrasonic instrumentation was provided. This was followed by subgingival application of an 8.5% w/w doxycycline polymer at sites with a remaining PPD of > or =5 mm. The patients of the \"debridement\" group were initially subjected to a 45-minute full-mouth debridement with the use of an ultrasonic instrument and without administration of local analgesia, and followed by application of doxycycline in sites with a PPD of > or =5 mm. At month 3, sites with a remaining PPD of > or =5 mm were subjected to scaling and root planing. Clinical re-examinations were performed at 3 and 6 months."
11442735,RESULTS,RESULTS,"At 3 months, the proportion of sites showing PPD of < or =4 mm was significantly higher in the \"debridement\" group than in the \"SRP\" group (58% versus 50%; p<0.05). The CAL gain at 3 months amounted to 0.8 mm in the \"debridement\" group and 0.5 mm in the \"SRP\" group (p=0.064). The proportion of sites demonstrating a clinically significant CAL gain (> or =2 mm) was higher in the \"debridement\" group than in the \"SRP\" group (38% versus 30%; p<0.05). At the 6-month examination, no statistically significant differences in PPD or CAL were found between the two treatment groups. BoP was significantly lower for the \"debridement\" group than for the \"SRP\" group (p<0.001) both at 3- and 6 months. The mean total treatment time (baseline and 3-month) for the \"SRP\" patients was 3:11 h, compared to 2:00 h for the patients in the \"debridement\" group (p<0.001)."
11442735,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSION,The results indicate that simplified subgingival instrumentation combined with local application of doxycycline in deep periodontal sites can be considered as a justified approach for non-surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis.
11966386,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVES,The Bethesda 2001 Workshop was convened to evaluate and update the 1991 Bethesda System terminology for reporting the results of cervical cytology. A primary objective was to develop a new approach to broaden participation in the consensus process.
11966386,METHODS,PARTICIPANTS,"Forum groups composed of 6 to 10 individuals were responsible for developing recommendations for discussion at the workshop. Each forum group included at least 1 cytopathologist, cytotechnologist, clinician, and international representative to ensure a broad range of views and interests. More than 400 cytopathologists, cytotechnologists, histopathologists, family practitioners, gynecologists, public health physicians, epidemiologists, patient advocates, and attorneys participated in the workshop, which was convened by the National Cancer Institute and cosponsored by 44 professional societies. More than 20 countries were represented."
11966386,METHODS,EVIDENCE,"Literature review, expert opinion, and input from an Internet bulletin board were all considered in developing recommendations. The strength of evidence of the scientific data was considered of paramount importance."
11966386,METHODS,CONSENSUS PROCESS,"Bethesda 2001 was a year-long iterative review process. An Internet bulletin board was used for discussion of issues and drafts of recommendations. More than 1000 comments were posted to the bulletin board over the course of 6 months. The Bethesda Workshop, held April 30-May 2, 2001, was open to the public. Postworkshop recommendations were posted on the bulletin board for a last round of critical review prior to finalizing the terminology."
11966386,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,Bethesda 2001 was developed with broad participation in the consensus process. The 2001 Bethesda System terminology reflects important advances in biological understanding of cervical neoplasia and cervical screening technology.
12416895,OBJECTIVE,PURPOSE,"The purpose of the study was to analyze the results with radiotherapy alone in a select group of asymptomatic adults with nonbulky, early-stage lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease."
12416895,METHODS,PATIENTS AND METHODS,"Between 1963 and 1995, 36 patients with nonbulky stage IA (N = 27) or IIA (N = 9) supradiaphragmatic (N = 27) or subdiaphragmatic (N = 9) lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease were treated with radiotherapy alone. Eleven of the patients underwent laparotomy. Limited-field radiotherapy involving only one side of the diaphragm and extended-field radiotherapy encompassing both sides of the diaphragm were used in 28 and 8 cases, respectively. Median dose to involved areas was 40.0 Gy given daily in 20 2.0-Gy fractions. Salvage treatmentconsisted of MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone, procarbazine), CVPP/ABDIC (cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone/doxorubicin, bleomycin, dacarbazine, lomustine, and prednisone), or ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy and/or involved-field radiotherapy."
12416895,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Median follow-up was 8.8 years (range, 3.0-34.4 years). None of the 15 patients with supradiaphragmatic disease who received limited-field radiotherapy to regions that did not include the mediastinal or hilar nodes subsequently experienced relapse there. Only one of 20 patients who received supradiaphragmatic limited-field radiotherapy alone experienced relapse in the paraaortic nodes or spleen. The 5-year relapse-free and overall survival rates for the 20 patients with stage IA lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease treated with involved-field or regional radiotherapy were 95% and 100%, respectively. There were no cases of severe or life-threatening cardiac toxicity. No solid tumors have been observed in-field in patients treated with limited-field radiotherapy, even though they have been followed up longer than those treated with extended-field radiotherapy (median follow-up, 11.6 vs 5.5 years); two solid tumors have developed in-field in patients who received extended-field radiotherapy."
12416895,CONCLUSIONS,DISCUSSION,"Involved-field or regional radiotherapy alone may be adequate in stage IA lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease patients. Longer follow-up will help to more clearly define the risks of cardiac toxicity and solid tumors that result from involved-field or regional radiotherapy, which appear to be low based on follow-up to date."
14668030,BACKGROUND,INTRODUCTION,"The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether polymorphism of the IL-6 promoter gene affects platelet counts among patients with Gaucher disease since it has been shown that in healthy individuals, the CC genotype is correlated with lower platelet counts."
14668030,METHODS,METHODS,Blood samples from all adult patients seen at a referral clinic during a 12 month period were taken for PCR analysis for the IL-6 promoter polymorphism. Platelet counts were culled from the records on date of presentation and prior to advent of enzyme replacement therapy where relevant.
14668030,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Of 138 Ashkenazi Jewish patients, 31 patients had platelet counts <60,000/mm<PRE>3</PRE> and 37 patients had normal platelet counts (>150,000/mm<PRE>3</PRE>). Of the former group, 4/31 (13%) and of the latter group, 3/37 (8%), had the CC genotype. Although all seven patients had relatively mild Gaucher disease (only one required therapy), there was no statistically significant difference in allele frequency of the IL-6 promoter polymorphism in either group relative to healthy Ashkenazi Jews."
14668030,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSION,"Whether comparing patients with Gaucher disease with normal platelet counts or with thrombocytopenia to healthy Ashkenazi Jews, there was no difference in frequency of the CC state. Thus, the IL-6 promoter polymorphism may not influence Gaucher disease to induce lower platelet counts as shown in other normal Caucasians."
14695699,OBJECTIVE,BACKGROUND/AIMS,"The diagnosis of refractory ascites means a poor prognosis for patients with liver cirrhosis. The definition of refractory ascites has already been established, but using the dosage of diuretics that correlates with the definition of refractory ascites in an out-patient department will lower the compliance of the patient, as well as causing serious complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy and hyponatremia, as the dosage of diuretics is increased. Due to this fact, it is very difficult to apply this definition of refractory ascites to patients in a domestic out-patient department. In this study, in situations where there are difficulties in applying the diuretics dosage according to definition of refractory ascites, we tried to find out whether measuring the value of urine sodium after the administration of intravenous furosemide can be the standard in early differentiation of the response to diuretics treatment."
14695699,METHODS,METHODS,"We reviewed 16 cases of liver cirrhosis with ascites and classified them into two groups by the response to diuretics. The diuretics-responsive ascites group was 8 cases and the diuretics-unresponsive ascites group consisted of 8 cases. After admission, we examined the patients' CBC, biochemical liver function test, spot urine sodium, and 24 hour creatinine clearance. After the beginning of the experiment, all diuretic therapy was stopped for 3 days. Daily we examined the patients' CBC, biochemical liver function test, and in the 3rd experiment day, we measured 24-hour urine volume and sodium. In the 4th experiment day, after sampling for ADH, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone level, we administrated the furosemide 80 mg I.V, and measured the amount of 8 hour urine volume and sodium."
14695699,RESULTS,RESULTS,"The plasma aldosterone level was significantly higher in the diuretics- unresponsive ascites group than in the diuretics-responsive ascites group. In the 4th experiment day, the amount of urine volume and sodium was very significantly lower in the diuretics-unresponsive ascites group than in the diuretics-responsive ascites group (1297.5 +/-80.9 vs 2003.7 +/-114.6 ml, p<0.005, 77.3 +/-8.2 vs 211.8 +/-12.6 mEq, p<0.001)."
14695699,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,"In out-patient departments, the measurement of urine sodium 8 hours after administrating 80 mg of intravenous furosemide, will help in differentiating ascites patients with lower treatment response to diuretics."
15968009,BACKGROUND,BACKGROUND,There is concern that exogenous female hormones may worsen disease activity in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
15968009,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVE,To evaluate the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on disease activity in postmenopausal women with SLE.
15968009,METHODS,DESIGN,"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial conducted from March 1996 to June 2002."
15968009,METHODS,SETTING,16 university-affiliated rheumatology clinics or practices in 11 U.S. states.
15968009,METHODS,PATIENTS,"351 menopausal patients (mean age, 50 years) with inactive (81.5%) or stable-active (18.5%) SLE."
15968009,METHODS,INTERVENTIONS,"12 months of treatment with active drug (0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen daily, plus 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone for 12 days per month) or placebo. The 12-month follow-up rate was 82% for the HRT group and 87% for the placebo group."
15968009,METHODS,MEASUREMENTS,"The primary end point was occurrence of a severe flare as defined by Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus, National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index composite."
15968009,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Severe flare was rare in both treatment groups: The 12-month severe flare rate was 0.081 for the HRT group and 0.049 for the placebo group, yielding an estimated difference of 0.033 (P = 0.23). The upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the treatment difference was 0.078, within the prespecified margin of 9% for noninferiority. Mild to moderate flares were significantly increased in the HRT group: 1.14 flares/person-year for HRT and 0.86 flare/person-year for placebo (relative risk, 1.34; P = 0.01). The probability of any type of flare by 12 months was 0.64 for the HRT group and 0.51 for the placebo group (P = 0.01). In the HRT group, there were 1 death, 1 stroke, 2 cases of deep venous thrombosis, and 1 case of thrombosis in an arteriovenous graft; in the placebo group, 1 patient developed deep venous thrombosis."
15968009,CONCLUSIONS,LIMITATIONS,"Findings are not generalizable to women with high-titer anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or previous thrombosis."
15968009,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,Adding a short course of HRT is associated with a small risk for increasing the natural flare rate of lupus. Most of these flares are mild to moderate. The benefits of HRT can be balanced against the risk for flare because HRT did not significantly increase the risk for severe flare compared with placebo.
17059514,BACKGROUND,BACKGROUND,"Although thiopurines have a proven role in maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease, an alternative therapy is needed for patients intolerant or resistant to thiopurines."
17059514,OBJECTIVE,AIM,To evaluate the effectiveness of home enteral nutrition as a maintenance therapy regimen in which half of the daily calorie requirement is provided by an elemental diet and the remaining half by a free diet. We refer to this home enteral nutrition therapy as 'half elemental diet'.
17059514,METHODS,METHODS,"Between 2002 and 2005, 51 patients in remission from two hospitals were randomly assigned to a half elemental diet group (n = 26) or a free diet group (n = 25). The primary outcome measure of this study was the occurrence of relapse over the 2-year period."
17059514,RESULTS,RESULTS,The relapse rate in the half elemental diet group was significantly lower [34.6% vs. 64.0%; multivariate hazard ratio 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16-0.98)] than that in the free diet group after a mean follow-up of 11.9 months. Compliance was similar in the two groups. No adverse event occurred in any of the patients throughout the study.

17713168,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVES,A major barrier to successful viral suppression in HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals is the emergence of virus resistant to antiretroviral drugs. We explored the evolution of genotypic drug resistance prevalence in treatment-failing patients from 1999 to 2005 in a clinical cohort.
17713168,METHODS,PATIENTS AND METHODS,Prevalence of major International AIDS Society-USA HIV-1 drug resistance mutations was measured over calendar years in a population with treatment failure and undergoing resistance testing. Predictors of the presence of resistance mutations were analysed by logistic regression.
17713168,RESULTS,RESULTS,"Significant reductions of the prevalence of resistance to all three drug classes examined were observed. This was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of treatment-failing patients. Independent predictors of drug resistance were the earlier calendar year, prior use of suboptimal nucleoside analogue therapy, male sex and higher CD4 levels at testing."
17713168,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,"In a single clinical cohort, we observed a decrease in the prevalence of resistance to all three examined antiretroviral drug classes over time. If this finding is confirmed in multicentre cohorts it may translate into reduced transmission of drug-resistant virus from treated patients."
18719013,OBJECTIVE,OBJECTIVE,To assess the effect of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on health related quality of life.
18719013,METHODS,DESIGN,Randomised placebo controlled double blind trial.
18719013,METHODS,SETTING,"General practices in United Kingdom (384), Australia (94), and New Zealand (24)."
18719013,METHODS,PARTICIPANTS,"Postmenopausal women aged 50-69 at randomisation; 3721 women with a uterus were randomised to combined oestrogen and progestogen (n=1862) or placebo (n=1859). Data on health related quality of life at one year were available from 1043 and 1087 women, respectively."
18719013,METHODS,INTERVENTIONS,Conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5/5.0 mg or matched placebo orally daily for one year.
18719013,METHODS,MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES,"Health related quality of life and psychological wellbeing as measured by the women's health questionnaire. Changes in emotional and physical menopausal symptoms as measured by a symptoms questionnaire and depression by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies depression scale (CES-D). Overall health related quality of life and overall quality of life as measured by the European quality of life instrument (EuroQol) and visual analogue scale, respectively."
18719013,RESULTS,RESULTS,"After one year small but significant improvements were observed in three of nine components of the women's health questionnaire for those taking combined HRT compared with those taking placebo: vasomotor symptoms (P<0.001), sexual functioning (P<0.001), and sleep problems (P<0.001). Significantly fewer women in the combined HRT group reported hot flushes (P<0.001), night sweats (P<0.001), aching joints and muscles (P=0.001), insomnia (P<0.001), and vaginal dryness (P<0.001) than in the placebo group, but greater proportions reported breast tenderness (P<0.001) or vaginal discharge (P<0.001). Hot flushes were experienced in the combined HRT and placebo groups by 30% and 29% at trial entry and 9% and 25% at one year, respectively. No significant differences in other menopausal symptoms, depression, or overall quality of life were observed at one year."
18719013,CONCLUSIONS,CONCLUSIONS,Combined HRT started many years after the menopause can improve health related quality of life.
